# Tuire Viita-aho – Future UI/UX Designer with an Interest in Accessibility 
 
Hi there! 👋

I am a soon-to-be Master of Science in Computer Science from Tampere University, specializing in Human-Technology Interaction. I have versatile skills in UX and UI design, accessibility, communication, and software development. My educational background in technical, business, and humanities studies provides me with a broad perspective and the ability to adapt to diverse situations. During my studies, I have successfully led multiple projects, worked in multicultural teams, and written many reports and thesises.

I aspire to design user-friendly and accessible digital services. I am known as a social and empathetic team player, a booster of team spririt, and a strong communicator with an eye for detail and the ability to manage both the big picture and finer details. I thrive in collaborative work environments that encourage development and innovation. I am a committed and quick-learning professional who brings a wide range of skills, creativity, and positivity to any team.

I'm currently on study leave from my role as a software developer at Digia, where I specialize in the Magento / Adobe Commerce e-commerce platform. In the future, I want to work as a UX/UI designer or UX researcher, so I'm open to new opportunities. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information! 🙂
